# Customers-Binary-Classification

There is a dataset with information about users of a certain site.
Based on this data, we want to predict, for example, whether the customer will make a purchase or not (binary classification).

Completed stages of work:
- data processing
- dataset cleanup
- data visualization
- feature selection

The dataset is downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
